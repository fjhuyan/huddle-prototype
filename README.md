This is a super quick mini project I prototyped for an app idea I had
to take as an opportunity to learn the basics of Kotlin as well as
learning how to set up a Node.js backend server with a MySQL database
backend. I ended up really disliking the way Kotlin handles UI
design with its "UI in Code" ideaology but I'm hoping to flesh
this prototype out in native android using what I've learned here about
backend servers and databases.
